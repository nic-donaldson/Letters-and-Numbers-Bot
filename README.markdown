An IRC bot that plays games similar to those found in Letters and Numbers.
Very messy and incomplete, the generation of letters and numbers needs work.
Also commenting, lots of commenting needs to be added and fixed up.

#### TODO:

 * make LettersGenerator (generators.py)
 * Learn about finite state machines and try to implement the logic that way
 * Clean up `LN_process_commands`, maybe `IRC_LN_commands`.
